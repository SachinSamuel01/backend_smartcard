IoT & Commercial
Ready for 5G Devices

Networks are rolling out worldwide. These networks will enable ultra-fast speeds, low 
latency, lower power, and high network capacities, transforming not only smartphones,
but billions of interconnected Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
High-performance and high-capacity storage will play a key role for OEMs, hardware 
vendors, applications developers and consumers. Western Digital offers iNAND® with
the latest UFS 3.1 specification to enable the performance demands of 5G devices
and applications.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming a key differentiator for mobile devices as smartphone 
OEMs combine high-resolution cameras with AI to enable a typical consumer to easily 
produce prosumer-quality images. Multiple high-resolution world-facing cameras combined 
with high-resolution ‘selfie’ cameras, enabled with AI editing, are producing larger image 
file sizes and driving a need for even higher capacity. Dedicated AI functionality in the 
smartphone not only enables photography but turns the smartphone into the central hub
of the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution.
OEMs and hardware vendors are working closely with application developers to bring 
compelling augmented reality, virtual reality and high-end gaming experiences to 
smartphones. High-quality games and expansive virtual environments require high capacity 
and high performance to build, map and display these interactive applications. High-
speed, low-latency 5G networks will connect consumers, workers and game players to 
these immersive environments. Media will be transformed with 5G speeds, allowing for fast 
download of movies and rapid upload of photos and videos.
Western Digital iNAND products offer multiple interfaces and form factors, giving OEMs
and applications developers the flexibility to deliver a portfolio of products differentiated 
with performance and storage capacity at competitive price points. Western Digital’s 
leading 3D NAND technology delivers performance and capacities to empower
the 5G data revolution.
